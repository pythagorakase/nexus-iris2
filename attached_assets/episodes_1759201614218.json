Moments later an assassination attempt signals the op is already compromised. Tracing the hitman’s network link leads the Snake to a gang-run server farm where they plant a back-door, steal an encrypted file called BLACKOUT PROTOCOL, and subvert an impending data-purge. Forced off-grid, the Snake flees a breached safehouse, gathers gear and misdirection tools inside Night City, then rides for the Badlands to find eccentric hacker “No-Name Pete” who can break the encryption—all while laying false trails that lure a Dynacorp response team into a fabricated crisis.\", \"TIMELINE\": [\"THEN: The episode opens with the Storyteller presenting three life-paths; the player chooses “Corpo Snake.”\", \"THEN: At the Skyline Lounge, Victor Sato offers an off-the-books extraction of Dr. Alina Voss.

The hour finishes Pete’s engineered “training arc,” deepens Alex and Nyati’s strategic and emotional dialogue about Nexus, and launches an informal long-con to discover Dr. Nyati’s romantic orientation.  By last call Pete leaves with the night’s “Wild-Card” suitor, Nyati loses a friendly wager and owes breakfast, and Alex ends the evening in Emilia’s arms, the team’s morale at an all-season high.\", \"TIMELINE\": [\"THEN: Inside the club, Alex toasts Pete and declares he has entered a “training arc”; Pete grumbles that the situation is “psychological warfare.”\", \"THEN: Emilia pushes Pete’s empty glass toward him, instructing him to get another drink and “see who buys it,” steering him toward two interested men.\", \"THEN: Pete realises he is being set up again, scans the room, and finally chooses to play along; Alex and Alina observe, Alina notes “adaptation confirmed.”\", \"THEN: Alex decides to leave wing-woman duties to Emilia and pivots to Alina for Nexus-2.0 refinement talk while maintaining visual on Pete.\", \"THEN: Alex scans the club for Dr. Nyati; finds her at a corner table, arms crossed but still present; Alex engages her.\", \"THEN: Nyati admits she stayed “to see if he closes”; Alex proposes a bet on which suitor Pete will choose—Nyati selects the Casual Flirt; stakes: breakfast vs. admitting the night wasn’t a waste.\", \"THEN: Conversation shifts to Nexus.

At dawn the crew returns to Le Chat Noir, completes Sullivan’s adoption without incident, and transfers to their mobile land-rig to begin analysis of Raven’s Echo intel.
