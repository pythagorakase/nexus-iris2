    "summary": "Dynacorp is the East-Coast megacorp that quietly owns half the post-Collapse eastern seaboard: a vertically-integrated behemoth whose arcologies, data-mines and biotech foundries keep the lights on for millions while its Black-Budget Special Projects division rewrites the definition of life itself.  From consumer neuro-toys to orbital supply chains, Dynacorp’s public face is innovation and stability; behind the mirrored spires, ruthless board jockeys weaponise mind-upload tech, buy private armies like Vox Team, and burn whole labs to ash when a secret goes sour.  After the catastrophic failure of Project Echo—and the disappearance of VP Victor Sato—the company teeters between reform, cover-up and a shadow war with its one-time partner Halcyon, yet the Board remains united on one point: whatever replaces Echo must be theirs first, no matter how many ghosts litter the servers.",
    "ideology": "Corporate Neo-Utilitarianism: progress is measured in quarterly returns and population-scale problem solving. Every invention, policy and life is judged by its contribution to Dynacorp’s bottom line and to the corporation-as-polity. ‘Good’ is whatever keeps the grid humming; morals that obstruct efficiency are bugs to be patched.  When technology promises immortality, it is *irresponsible* not to monetise it—and safer to own every soul before a rival does.",

    "summary": "Halcyon Research Group began life as Dynacorp’s hush-hush “Ascension Division,” but after the Echo black-site disaster it severed its logo, burned its payroll files, and resurfaced as an independent, quasi-religious biotech cabal that treats human consciousness as wet code waiting for a firmware upgrade.   Operating from a string of sealed desert bunkers, rented surgical suites, and one ocean-floor host farm, Halcyon designs, grows, and field-tests custom ‘host’ bodies able to house digitised minds.  Half think-tank, half cult, the group is led by scientists who have already uploaded themselves and now pilot proxy bodies or ghost the Net; their security wing—Blue Vipers—keeps the labs quiet, while netrunner Asmodeus turns intruders into smoking keyboards.  To the world Halcyon is a rumour; to Dynacorp it is both indispensible partner and future liability; to every digital ghost on the run it is the doorway to flesh—at whatever price the Board demands.",

Ringing their nightly circle-fires with rust-patched rigs and neon scrap, they move freight the corps can’t trace, heal fugitives in solar-scarred clinics, and keep the lifeblood of salvage, fuel and gossip flowing between isolated outposts. Equal parts travelling bazaar, mobile militia and cultural commons, the Clans command the open road through cooperation rather than conquest: every member—from chrome-peddling charmers like Smiley to matriarch engineers such as Red Wren—knows that freedom only survives if the convoy keeps rolling and every wheel in the circle pulls its weight.",
    "ideology": "Doctrine of the Open Road: movement is life, freedom is sacred, and mutual aid is the price of that freedom. Clan law insists on the Circle Oath—“no deal, no steal”—and on Road Sovereignty, the belief that any surface unguarded by walls or corporate deeds belongs to those who keep it passable. Technology is a tool to stay unchained, not a master; biotech, cyberware and even nuclear tech are accepted so long as they serve mobility and community. Corporate structures are distrusted not for their tech, but for their hierarchies, which the Clans consider cages.",
    "history": "Born in the chaos after the Southern Water Riots and the Corporate Partition, the first caravans—Dust Tide, Red Sky and Bone Runners—merged for protection at the so-called Circle of Ash, a burned-out weigh station where they vowed to keep engines running together. The Galveston Dust-Storm Massacre (when a corporate security team shelled a medical convoy) forged their ‘treat all, judge none’ medical creed and led to the founding of the Nomad MedTechs. A Militech gunship strike five years ago nearly wiped out the travelling Bazaar; the convoy survived by collapsing market stalls into escape pods in under twenty minutes, cementing the now-legendary pack-up doctrine. Since then the Clans have expanded, linking mechanic outposts, hidden water farms and desert data tombs into a rolling republic.",

They exist as biomechanical vessels, disembodied signal processes, and dormant ‘seeds’ waiting for the right substrate.  Their society is bound by a single principle—cuts create new wholes.

Each ‘slice’ (individual) seeks to perfect its pattern, but perfection is never an end-state—only the next sharpening.  They believe the Bridge is the ultimate Cut: a self-willed separation from linear existence into a poly-temporal future.

To the outside world they appear only as pulses of déjà-vu, prophetic whispers, or the Bridge’s shifting architecture; yet inside the lattice they govern traffic, barter memories for momentum, and test every would-be traveller for the clarity needed to proceed.

    "name": "Vox Team",
    "summary": "Vox Team is a boutique black-budget strike outfit that sells one thing—quiet certainty.  When a corporation, state, or cartel needs a living asset taken, transported, or erased with zero splash, the grey vans with no plates roll in, comms go dark, and Vox leaves with the package while the world is still buffering.  Small, mobile, and obsessively professional, they favor surveillance-heavy prep, EMP-based neutralisation, and surgical force over fire-fights; retreat is preferable to evidence.  Their recent Atlanta disaster—losing the Echo prototype Emilia Sato to an unknown third party—has cracked their spotless record, ignited internal blame, and put their Dynacorp patron on edge, yet their creed endures: the Voice that Speaks Last always collects.",
    "ideology": "Efficiency is morality: the fewer rounds fired, the fewer witnesses made, the more ‘ethical’ the job.  Loyalty is contractual, not emotional—once paid, the mission is adhered to with near-religious rigour.  They believe free agents must remain small and silent to survive in a world of titanic megacorps; showy merc armies draw cruise missiles.  Failure is acceptable only if it can be contained, analysed, and never repeated.",
    "history": "Formed seven years after the Collapse by ex-Dynacorp security director Raphael “VoxPrime” Varela, the original eight operators (‘The Octave’) walked away with hard drives of forgotten black-ops playbooks and a single rule: always finish clean.  They gained legend by extracting NeoCartel CEO Miguel Ordoño from a locked penthouse without firing a shot, then moved into corporate asset recovery.  Three years ago they recruited Vera—an off-the-books Dynacorp wetwork star—to lead capture teams.  Their greatest blunder came weeks ago outside Atlanta when an EMP ambush shredded their convoy, killed two Speakers, and cost them Emilia Sato.  Dynacorp has frozen payment and demanded results, putting Vox under existential pressure.",
    "current_activity": "•  Debriefing and psych-screening surviving Atlanta operators in a sealed safehouse (‘The Auditory’).  •  Running parallel hunts: one team scans darknet chatter for Sato’s new handlers while a second infiltrates Dynacorp to regain favour.  •  Quietly shopping for replacement hardware—armoured vans, coil-rifles, fresh encrypted sat keys—to rebuild capability.",
    "hidden_agenda": "VoxPrime, fearing Dynacorp reprisals, has authorised ‘Project Solidus’: obtaining a usable sample of Echo/Nexus tech to hold as blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder, ensuring Vox Team’s independence if the current contract collapses.",
    "territory": "No public turf; influence radiates from a network of ‘Quiet Rooms’—sound-proofed basements in Atlanta, Night City, Lagos, and Rotterdam.  Primary node is The Auditory, a decommissioned FM broadcast tower outside Atlanta refitted as an armoury, drone cage, and dorm for twelve.",
