Great! And I’m going to bed and have turned your autonomy setting to maximum, so this seems like a good opportunity to say “all of the above” and give you some extra tasks to boot. Take your time, think about how to make all this data browsable in a way that’s more enjoyable than my current method of scrolling through TablePlus. Use your best judgment and don’t be afraid to be creative and take some artistic risks!

# Narrative Data
Yes, go ahead and wire this up with an outline browser to make it navigable. There should be an expandable/collapsible hierarchical outline structure so I can click on Season 3, expanding it into episodes, click on S03E04 expanding it into chunks, then tap or click on the chunk (just label them with their slugs or scene number) to jump to that point. You get the idea. 

# Zones & Places
If you remember or want to look again at the Lovable Iris repo I shared, this has a somewhat functional implementation I’d like you to recreate and improve on. It had a map view with a subdued minimal background that was basically just land/coast outlines, with a pin for every place entry that I could click on. I think it only displayed names, so feel free to get creative with all the data I gave you and make it more like a modern map app, so tapping on a pin brings up a profile page and such. I think in the Lovable version I could zoom with mouse wheel, but I should be able to pinch and such on mobile too. 

Bonus points for implementing the zones. These are just meant to be regions that contain the places and sort them into groups, so all you’d really need to do here is shade the zones with different colors—preferably something that doesn’t hurt my eyes!

In the previous implementation you needed a console command to enter the map view. That’s cute, but I think a map tab makes more sense. 
# Characters
Let’s add a character tab! Give them profile pages with a section for each column.

Group them by ID rather than alphabetically, because I used the tens digit as a way of unofficially grouping them. The (1, 10) range is reserved for main characters. The (90, 100) people are pretty minor characters who may not even have lines in the narrative text yet (despite the creative backfill I’ve given them). 

Make a space for profile pictures and leave them as dark silhouettes for now, like most websites do if you avoid uploading a picture and haven’t picked an avatar. I’ll just give you one for now. It’s Alex. 

Give each profile a “relationships” button that lets you see a list of names they have relationship entries for, and a “psychological profile” button only if they have an entry in the “character_psychology” table.
